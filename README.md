## Overall

Sometimes, changing the X-Forwarded-For might not work. So using the proxy might be a solution. 

**GetProxies.py** crawls latest usable proxy addresses from *https://free-proxy-list.net/* (You may change it for other  proxy list website you want, I just randomly google one)

**AddPeanuts.py** is a demo using crawled proxies. (一亩三分地刷花生)
